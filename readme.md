**README**

This bot is intended for use in ONE guild only. If you want to use this bot, please clone
the git repository and create your own bot. 

**SETUP**

To set up the bot:

`1)` Run `bot.py` then use CTRL+C to kill it. 

`2)` Open `config.json`

`3)` Fill in each of the fields with your bot's information.

`4)` Invite the bot to your server.

`5)` Run the bot. 

**NOTE**

`config.json` and `prohibited_words.json` are in `.gitignore`, so pulling or merging
should not cause the bot to lose any data. Deleting these files or removing them from `.gitignore`
can cause problems.
